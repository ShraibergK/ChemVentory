## How To Use Github

### Github Commands
Cloning a directory into a new folder->  git clone https://github.com/therealmartytheparty/ChemVentory

Adding everything into the staging are -> git add .   

Adding a certain file into the staging area -> git add "insertfile"
  
Commiting all code that has been added to the staging area -> git commit -a

Commiting code along with adding a message related to the commit ( dont need but could be helpful) -> git commit -am "message"

Pulling all the changed code in a branch ( in this case it is the master branch) -> git pull origin master
